# Dominoes-AI-Project
Dominoes is a very prevalent game in my culture, which inspired me to want to see if I could create an AI model to play 2 Player dominoes. This is a heavy work in progress but I hope to make updates semi regularly.


MOST RECENT UPDATE:
  - Game now only allows legal moves
  - Turns Alternate as intended, and dominos are drawn from the drawpile if there are no legal moves

    
KNOWN ISSUES:
  - Dominos go off screen when the snake gets too long
  - No tracking of wins or scores


DOMIMOES RULES FOR THIS PROJECT
Two players start with a hand of 7 dominoes. Player with the highest double goes first, if no players have a double, the player with the highest value domino goes first. Dominoes can be player on either of the two sides if they contain a matching number. If a player cannot play a Domino, they must draw from the draw pile until they can play, unless there are no dominoes left to draw, in which case they pass. If no dominos are in the draw pile, turns are skipped instead. The winner is whoever gets rid of their dominoes first. Scoring is based the number of dots on the remaining dominoes when the game ends.
